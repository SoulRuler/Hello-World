This file is for how my I love myself at the moment and over time

January 1 : I love myself a good 5/8 at the moment

Febuary 27 : I LOVE MYSELF SO MUCH, at my basketball game I only passed out twice instead of the usualy 4 times

Today : I just thought of Parley and that made me happy 10/11 happiness. (Its not 100% because I am not dating parley)

April 35 : Today is just a bland day. I ate some toast and kicked a cucumber. So nothing crazy has happened. So today I love myself 1/0 (If you dont get
that joke then you are not smart. Do some math and put that in a calculator and then we can have a good laugh)

Flebugrandur .6 : IM SO HAPPY, i got kissed by a sexy blonde boy. No it wasnt Parley, and yes it was a dream. but still it was a good dream
10/18 for today. 

Yesterday : death, life, the imbetween. What are we really. why do we really exist. why are we here. These questions can all be answer by me. Just for a small payment 
of a small potato and $37.87 in cash. I can tell you why you are here. (Warning, I will ever be right. I just want your money and potatos)

June : why am I so cute. Yea I know that i am like a 7/1918o33ydh3nh but that still does not mean I cant be cute <3 :D
