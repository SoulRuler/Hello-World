Sports?

Yes this is a file about sports and different stuff about how much i love sports becuase i am a sports monster and i play 
sports all the time and i think that everyone should play sports and die while playing sports or you are a loser

So yea, I just have a basketball game tomorrow

So I also love sports becuase of butts. Yea sports guys butts are the best

I played sports as a kid, now I did this so I could hang out with Dallin Corrington. He was nice and 
attractive and we played soccor together so I played the sport. Now he did leave and I kept playing becuase I was the best there
was, but regardless, Sports boys are the best.

I dont watch sports, I only play sports. I'm so strong that my skills can only be shown or the court, feild, and or track. Watching sports is for the lazy.
I play all the sports you could ever think of. I even play sports that dont exist that i made up becuase that is how cool I am.

If you dont know what flurgurt ball is, then can we even be friends. The sports is like dodgeball, but it is also a game of chess. 
So the game works like this. So 10 people are playing dodgeball (5 on each team) and 2 people are playing chess. Now the dodge ball part is just like dodgeball but the
chess part changes the whole game. So when someone playing chess loses a chess peice then their teams dodgeball square gets smaller. that is it. if you dont play this then
you are punks
